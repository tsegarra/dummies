    <p>The notes in a given major scale all sound good together. If all the notes of a song are in a certain major scale, then we can say the song is in that scale’s key. For example, a song that uses only D, E, F#, G, A, B, and C# will be in the key of D.</p>

<p>When notating a song in D, you usually wouldn’t write a sharp sign next to every F# and C#. You’d put those two sharps right at the beginning of the piece, in what’s called the <strong>key signature</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/dummies/lilypond_files/9ca8967d93ed4f788ca094fea8e69834_trimmed.svg" alt="First line from Waitin' on the Day." class="" style="" /></p>

<p>If you see a key signature like the one above, with those two sharps, then it means every time you see an F or a C, it’s really F# or C# unless explicitly indicated otherwise.</p>

<p>The notes in a scale are also called scale <strong>degrees</strong>. So in the key of G, A is the second scale degree, F# is the seventh, etc.</p>

<p>A <strong>key</strong> is the context that gives each note is emotional quality. So for example in the key of E, the note E sounds pleasant, stable, and resolved. That’s because it’s the first scale degree, also called the <strong>tonic</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/dummies/lilypond_files/2f06f652cd22cac225cc4d11c8de9363_trimmed.svg" alt="First line of Under the Bridge." class="" style="" /></p>

<p>Listen to the E’s. (Second syllable of “feel,” “like,” “have,” and the second syllable of “partner.”) They sound so well-adjusted.</p>

<p>But if you play an E in the key of F, that same pitch E will sound tense and unstable. In F, E is the seventh scale degree. It’s located one short half step below F, which gives it a quality of reaching up, like it anxiously wants to resolve upward to the tonic. That’s why in classical jargon it’s called the <strong>leading tone</strong>. It leads your ear back home to 1.</p>

<p>Imagine if Paul McCartney ended the bridge of Yesterday (which is in F) on the second syllable of “yesterday,” which is the note E:</p>

<p><img src="/dummies/lilypond_files/7f4bead84d9a4cb6f520485781ffc730_trimmed.svg" alt="End of Yesterday bridge, missing final note." class="" style="" /></p>

<p>It sounds maddening. But that tension nicely sets up the return to the tonic F in the final syllable of the word:</p>

<p><img src="/dummies/lilypond_files/9e66320d64208fe13c2f0f0602586030_trimmed.svg" alt="End of Yesterday bridge, including final note." class="" style="" /></p>

<p>Then the melody finally feels finished. (For a brief moment, before Paul tumbles back down the scale.)</p>

<p>These kinds of pitch relationships give melodies their sense of directed motion and evoke feelings of tension and resolution. That’s the tip of a big berg.</p>
