Most Western music is made of twelve notes: C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, A#/Bb, and B.

The distance between two adjacent notes is called a half step. So it's a half step between C and C#, or between E and F, or between B and C.

Two half steps make a whole step. A whole step is the distance between C and D, or between Eb and F.

# The major scale

Let's use "W" to represent a whole step, and "H" to represent a half step. If you start on any pitch and play the ascending sequence **W-W-H-W-W-W-H**, that's called the **major scale**, and it's a very important pattern. 

Take C for example. Make C the first note.

{% lilypond alt: "The note C written on a staff." trim: true %}
  \relative {
      \key c \major
	c''4
  } 
{% endlilypond %}

If you go up a whole step, then you skip C# and go straight to D.

{% lilypond alt: "The notes C and D written on a staff." trim: true %}
  \relative {
      \key c \major
	c''4 d
  } 
{% endlilypond %}

Then the pattern calls for another whole step. That takes us past D# to E.

{% lilypond alt: "The notes C, D, and E written on a staff." trim: true %}
  \relative {
      \key c \major
	c''4 d e
  } 
{% endlilypond %}

Then we reach the first half step, which goes from E to F. (Remember that there's no such note as E#.)

{% lilypond alt: "The notes C, D, E, and F written on a staff." trim: true %}
  \relative {
      \key c \major
	c''4 d e f
  } 
{% endlilypond %}

You get the idea. Whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half. You end up with C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C. And since we started on C, that's called the C major scale.

{% lilypond alt: "The C major scale." trim: true %}
  \relative {
      \key c \major
	c''4 d e f g a b c
  } 
{% endlilypond %}

If we started on G instead, we'd get G-A-B-C-D-E-F#-G. That's the G major scale.

{% lilypond alt: "The G major scale." trim: true %}
  \relative {
      \key c \major
    g'4 a b c d e fis g
  } 
{% endlilypond %}

Later I'll explain more thoroughly what it means to say a song is in a certain **key**. But for now I'll just point out that songs in the key of C major, for example, tend primarily to use notes from the C major scale. Like this one:

{% lilypond alt: "Prechorus of Don't Fear the Reaper." trim: true %}
  \relative {
      \key c \major
    a'8 a a4 g d8 e8~   e g4. r8 c, c c   a'4 a8 a b b b c~   c4
  } 
  \addlyrics {
    Sea -- sons don't fear the rea -- per, nor do the wind and the sun and the rain
  }
{% endlilypond %}

Songs in the key of G major (for short, "songs in G") likewise use notes from the G major scale. Note specifically the F# instead of F.

{% lilypond alt: "Prechorus of Why Georgia." trim: true %}
  \relative {
      \key c \major
      r2. g'8 g'~    g2.~ g8 g~     g fis r a,~ a b~ b4
  } 
  \addlyrics {
        Cause I won -- der some -- times
  }
{% endlilypond %}

As an exercise, try to work out which notes are in the D major scale.
